#bil-CV
This is my CV template class.  I've used it for some time, it was taken from somewhere long forgotten.

To build the documentation, run the following:
<pre>pdflatex bil-CV.dtx</pre>

To build the class file, run:
<pre>latex bil-CV.ins</pre>

Hopefully the documentation will make sense to you, but if it doesn't hopefully <pre>test_piece/test_CV.tex</pre> will aid your understanding.
